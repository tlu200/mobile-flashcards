# Mobile flashcards

A mobile application that allows users to study collections of flashcards. The app will allow users to create different categories of flashcards called "decks", add flashcards to those decks, then take quizzes on those decks.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React Native App](https://github.com/react-community/create-react-native-app).

The most recent version of this guide is available [here](https://github.com/react-community/create-react-native-app/blob/master/react-native-scripts/template/README.md).

## To start
